{}Why is the business of cosmetics, beauty, and personal care products in Africa booming? Africa’s beauty market is one of the most lucrative businesses too. Why? According to market research, it estimated the beauty industry in the Middle East and Africa at about $27.1 billion in 2018. Of this figure, South Africa alone represented $4.5 billion; Nigeria and Kenya are second and third among sub-Saharan nations, with Kenya’s market totaling more than $320 million. In comparison, it estimated the Asian market at $128 billion in the same year. As a result, the outlook for the African cosmetics, beauty, and personal care products market is very positive for the coming years as there is so much room for it to grow with the Asian markets.
